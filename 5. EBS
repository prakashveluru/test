EBS - ELASTIC BEAN STACK
=================================================================================================================================================================
 - With EBS we can deploy, monitor, and scale an application easily and transparent
 - EBS focus on performance not infrastructure like configuration and specifications
 
 
EBS is free, but the resources created by EBS will be charged
If we delete EBS application, resoucre created by EBS will also be deleted. 

If we upload our code or sample code then 
EBS will upload the code to S3 and from S3 it will launch other resources like EC2, secuirty group,DB and other.
S3 here is used for versioning
