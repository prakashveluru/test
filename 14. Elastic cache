- By using cache we can make UI user friendly


Elastic cache is used in between webservice and DB's

2 types of Elastic cache
1. Memcached
2. Redis (open source) --free

- Elasticache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy,
operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud.
- The service improves the performance of web applications
by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed,
in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower
disk-based databases.
- It can be used to significantly reduce latency and
throughput for many read-heavy application workloads
(such as social networking, gaming, media sharing and Q&A
portals) or compute-intensive workloads.
- Caching improves application performance by storing
critical pieces of data in memory for low-latency access.
