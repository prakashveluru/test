Cloud Trail ---> Is used for Auditing
==================================================================================================================================================================
Cloud Trail is used for tracking user activity 

Events history - We can see logs for last 90 days only.

Trails - By default we dont have any trails 
 - Trails are used for capturing logs on daily basis and we can store for long 
 - Trails are stored in S3
 
Cloud trail is region specific,but we can keep track of multi regions aswell

Limitations:
------------

we can create only 5 trails per region only.
