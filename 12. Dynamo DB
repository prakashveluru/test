Type      RDS         Architecture      Storage
RDS       Aurora      SQL               Structured(Row and Column)
Non-RDS   Dynamo DB   No-SQL            Key Value

For Dynamo DB we dont have ports to connect EC2 instance.(For RDS, we are using Security group to connect EC2 to DB).
In Dynamo DB we are using IAM Roles, We will attach IAM role to EC2 instance and Dynamo for connection


***** Alternative for access key and secrete key is IAM role
Starting point of role is service. what level of access needed for that service 

1. So we will create EC2-DynamoDB full access role
2. Launch t2.medium(atleast) & attach IAM role & bootstrap Dynamo DB script & allow https ports
3. Run 2 commands in /var/www/html
    . AWS SDK for php
    . composer
