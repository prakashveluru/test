Edge locations are used for cache the content of application/web application

A Content delivery network(CDN) is a distributed servers(network)(Edge location) that delivers webpages and other web content to a user based on the different geographical
location

Terminology

 - Edge locations: Edge location we are using for cache in CDN/CF. 
 - Origin: The Origin is the place where our application is hosted. This is the origin of all files that CDN will distribute. It can be
    . S3
    . EC2
    . ELB
    . R53
 - Distribute: It is a collection of Edge locations
 
 With out CF/CDN the application will be loaded into your laptop. So the response time for our website if we are accessing out side of our geolocation will be low
 If we have CF/CDN the application will be cached in nearest Edge locations and response time of our website will be high. Here also we will face some latency for first
 customers only.
 
 - Edge locations are not just read only we can write to it
