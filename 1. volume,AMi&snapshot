scale up/down-
  - know as vertical scaling
  - will be used for updating configurations like(CPU,RAM,EBS)
  
scale in/out- 
  - Know as horizontal scaling
  - will be used for increasing/descreasing no of machines 
  - This scenario is mainly used in Autoscaling
  
To Increase/Decrease volume for EC2 then - stopping instance is not required
To Increase/Decrease CPU/Ram resources then - we need to stop the instances

For root volume we have snapshot, for attached volumes we will not have any snapshot
snapshot here is instance - snapshot is created in backend and aws will attach the snapshot to root volume

** we will not find instance snapshot in snapshots

=================================================================================================================================================================
AMI - Amazon machine image

If we create ami 
  - First snapshot will be created
  - From snapshot, AMI will be created
  
If we copy AMI from 1 region to other region, then 
  - Snapshot of that ami will be copied
  - then ami will be copied to other region
 
AMI takes time because it deals with booting process

Security groups/Keypairs are region specific

SNAPSHOTS

- We cannot copy volumes directly, so we will create snapshot out of it
- By using snapshot we will create volumes
- Copy the snapshot to other region
- Create volume from snapshot by selecting region where our instance is present
- Attach the volume to the instance

From snapshot we can create 
  - AMI  --> deals with root volume --> So taking snapshot will be slow
  - Volume --> deals with non root volume --> So capturing snapshot will be fast
  
 
First we need to de-register AMI then we can delete snapshot in case 1

=====================================================================================================================================================================

Use case:

I have machine with 2 volumes(8GB, 10GB) which includes root volume, we need to share the snapshot for the machine. How can we do it?

Ans:
Case 1: In case we can take snapshot with AMI with both volumes and then we can share the AMI
Case 2: We can take snapshot for root volume independently and other volume independently then we can share AMI and snapshot

In case1 creating AMI will take more time because booting process and os file structure is involved
In case2 we are creating AMI seperately and volume snapshot seperatly the process will be more faster than case1.
