Red shift is like a Data ware house.

Data ware house is used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data.

Red shift is a fast and powerful, fully managed, petabyte-scale data ware house service in the cloud

1. Query Timeout
2. Capacity
3. Analystics

Red shift is region specific

Terminology
-----------------
LN- Leader Node  --> Taken care by AWS
CN - Compute Node --> Taken care by Leader Node ( client connections)


Capactiy of CN is 160 GB, we can launch only 128 CN for DataWare House.

Leader Node:

1. LN is point of contact b/w webservice and CN
2. LN is responsible for redirections(deciding which requests from Webservers has to be redirected to CN)
3. LN is responsible for maintaing client connections. 
4. Scalability of CN is also taken care by LN
5. No data is stored in LN

CN:

1. Actual data is present in CN
2. Analysists can be performed on CN


OLTP - Online Transaction Processing  --> Data stored in Rows and columns --> similar to DB
OLAP - Online Analytic Processing --> It is used to perform operation on data 


Massive Parellel processing(MPP)
-------------------------------------
Red shift automatically distribute the query load across all the nodes
Red shift makes it easiy to add nodes to your data warehouse and enables you to maintain fast query performance as your datawarehouse grows.
